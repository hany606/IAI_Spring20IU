# Assignment2

This directory includes my solution for this assignment.

## Description:

This assignment required implementing one of the evolutionary algorithms to generate  picture that looks like an input image in an artistic way.

The assignment is written fully in python.

## Specifications/Constraints:

* Input image: 512x512 pixels
* Output image (Generated): 512x512 pixels
* No using for other libraries for evolutionary algorithms


## Dependencies

* PIL

## How to use?

0. Put the input image in input directory

1. Run the following command to run the docker file to setup the docker container

    ```docker  ```

2. Run the following command to run the bash of the docker container

    ```docker ```

3. Inside the docker container's bash, run the following command and wait until it finishes

    ```python3 main.py```

4. To see the progress of the evolving of the image till the output, open the "output/out.gif"

5. To see the output image, open "output/out.[png/jpg]"



##  TODO:

1. Implement the codes.
2. Create the dockerfile in which there is volume shared between the container and the machine or use gui as in BCR
